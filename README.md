What did i do in this project? 
In this project, I created a main class named Besiktas and added two football players to this class. First, I defined the players' names and positions, and then I specified their statistics, including goals and assists.

Next, I created a child class called Besiktas_Esports. I added two esports players, defined their names and positions, and recorded their KDA (Kills/Deaths/Assists) statistics.

Finally, I created a second child class named Besiktas_Volleyball. Similarly, I added two volleyball players, defined their names and positions, and included their performance statistics.

For all three classes, I implemented methods to display the playersâ€™ information along with their respective statistics. This project demonstrates the use of inheritance, class structure, and basic data handling in Python.
